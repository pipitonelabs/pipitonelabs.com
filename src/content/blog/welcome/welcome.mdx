*Welcome to my new website.* I am a Cloud Engineer working on AWS, Azure, Infrastructure & Automation, and GitOps / Kubernetes. I like to continuously expand my knowledge using my HomeLab environment to deploy and experiment with open source technologies.

Over time, I'll have more content posted here, ultimately giving you an idea into what I'm working with, experimenting with, and breaking.

[Take a look at my GitHub](https://github.com/pipitonelabs) and feel free to reach out. As time goes on, I'll be posting more content as I try to tidy up things.

The source code for this blog can be reviewed here:

If you want to take a look at my Kubernetes repo, take a look here:
