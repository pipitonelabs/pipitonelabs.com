## Introduction

As a cloud engineer focused on leveling up my Kubernetes and modern DevOps expertise, I’m intentionally building real hands-on experience with agentic AI - autonomous agents that can reason step-by-step, orchestrate, and execute complex workflows with almost no hand-holding.
I’m convinced that if I don't start actively using these tools, I’ll fall behind fast. 

That’s why I’m experimenting with several different solutions and use cases, to see if I can incorporate them into my day-to-day, and if they improve my workflows. So far, it's been a great experience when it comes to managing my Kubernetes cluster in my HomeLab, and has been a big time saver. I've run a few personal experiments to learn (and move) even faster.

This post shares real hands-on experience with three standout tools: the VSCode extensions **Cline**, **Kilo Code**, **Claude Code**, plus Google's brand-new **Antigravity** agentic IDE (launched November 2025). 

I tested them on different scenarios: Kubernetes disaster recovery planning, Terraform module refactoring, and custom development of various web apps. My evaluation focused on autonomy, accuracy, IDE and CLI integration, and cost.

## My Testing Process

I have watched various YouTube videos of people who have done extreme benchmarking as well as extremely thorough test cases, which was a good starting point for me to get familiar with.

What I realized is - like many other things - the only way to determine which tool is "best" is to get in there, and see for myself.

Tasks by complexity:

1. Simple → Lint/syntax fixes in YAML/Terraform.
2. Medium → Multi-file refactors and modularization.
3. Complex → Full architecture design + implementation (e.g., multi-region K8s DR).

Criteria:

- Autonomy → How few interventions?
- Accuracy → Correct, complete, best-practice compliant?
- Practicality → Production-ready or still prototype-grade?
- Integration → Seamless in daily workflow?
- Failure modes → Hallucinations, context loss, looping, recovery ease.

## Cline: The Original Autonomous VSCode Agent

Cline (formerly Claude-Dev) was one of the first truly agentic VSCode extensions—open-source, human-in-the-loop, capable of reading/writing files, running terminal commands, browser automation, and multi-step reasoning.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent at conversational, long-running tasks with strong context retention.
- Safe by design (asks permission for every risky action).
- Multimodal (can view screenshots/images).
- Model-agnostic (works great with Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus, Gemini, local models via Ollama/OpenRouter).

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be inconsistent on very large codebases.
- Sometimes overconfident or loops on ambiguous prompts.
- Setup requires API keys and occasional tweaking.

**Example**: "Design a multi-region DR strategy for production K8s including etcd backups, PV replication, and traffic failover."

Output: Detailed plan using Velero + snapshots, etcd-operator backups, Crossplane/GKE multi-cluster setup, Istio/Global Traffic Routing. It even created the initial YAML manifests and a restore playbook.

Needed one follow-up for Velero bucket policies in secondary region. Overall, outstanding for planning.

**Ideal for**: Brainstorming, architecture, exploratory work.

## Kilo Code: Precision Surgical Agent

Kilo Code (kilo.ai) is currently the most polished and powerful open-source agentic extension for VSCode/JetBrains. It combines semantic codebase search, precise diff-based edits, terminal/browser tools, and multi-agent orchestration in one package.

**Strengths:**
- Superb codebase understanding and targeted edits (rarely touches unrelated files).
- Excellent tool chaining (search → read → plan → diff → test loop).
- Follows best practices religiously, great documentation in outputs.
- Supports virtually any model via OpenRouter or local.

**Weaknesses:**
- Steeper learning curve for custom modes/rules.
- Can be token-hungry on massive repos.
- Still asks for approval on big changes (which is good for safety).

**Example**: "Refactor this monolithic EKS Terraform module into reusable child modules with proper versioning and best practices."

It semantically searched the repo, split out VPC, IAM, node groups, addons; added locals/versioning; wrote READMEs; validated with tfvalidate/checkov. Result was cleaner than my manual version. Only minor tweak needed on output naming.

**Ideal for**: Heavy refactors, brownfield codebases, day-to-day engineering.

## Google Antigravity: The New Agent-First IDE

Launched just weeks ago (Nov 18, 2025), Antigravity is Google's bid to redefine the IDE for the Gemini 3 era. It's a standalone VSCode fork with two views: classic Editor (Copilot-like) and Agent Manager (dispatch multiple autonomous agents that work asynchronously across editor/terminal/browser).

**Strengths:**
- Truly multi-model out of the box (Gemini 3 Pro default + Claude 4.5/Opus, Mistral, Llama 405B, etc.) — no API keys needed for most during preview.
- Unique multi-agent orchestration: run 5+ agents in parallel on different tasks.
- Artifacts system (plans, screenshots, browser recordings) makes progress verifiable.
- Built-in browser control for end-to-end testing.
- Completely free right now with generous limits.

**Weaknesses (it's brand new):**
- Early bugs: occasional context loss on model switches, slow artifact generation, crashes on very large monorepos.
- Less mature extension ecosystem than VSCode.
- Slight Google/Gemini bias in defaults.

**Example**: Building a Kubernetes Operator in Go.

I dispatched three agents simultaneously:
- Gemini 3 Pro → CRD + manager scaffold.
- Claude Opus 4.5 → Reconciliation logic + RBAC.
- Mistral Large → Unit tests + debugging.

They coordinated via the shared knowledge base, produced verifiable artifacts, and ran `make test` loops autonomously. Final code passed operator-sdk score 95+. Still needed human review for edge cases.

**Ideal for**: Large-scale, parallelized development; experimenting with model ensembles.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect              | Cline                  | Kilo Code                | Antigravity                  |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Primary Focus       | Conversational autonomy / planning | Precise codebase surgery / refactoring | Multi-agent orchestration / full IDE |
| Best Tasks          | Architecture, brainstorming | Targeted edits, brownfield work | Parallel complex projects, e2e flows |
| Autonomy Level      | High (human-in-loop)   | Very high (approval-based) | Highest (async multi-agent)  |
| Multi-Model         | Yes (any via provider) | Yes (OpenRouter/local)   | Native (Gemini/Claude/Mistral/Llama etc.) |
| VSCode Native       | Yes                    | Yes                      | No (standalone VSCode fork)  |

## Takeaways & Honest Assessment

- These tools are legitimately transformative for speed — I cut DR planning time from days to hours.
- Synergy is real: Use Cline/Kilo inside VSCode for daily work, jump to Antigravity for big parallel agent runs.
- But skepticism warranted: All still hallucinate on obscure Kubernetes corner cases (e.g., etcd quorum edge cases, exotic CSI drivers). None are production-trustworthy without rigorous human review.
- Security/edge cases remain the Achilles heel — always test in non-prod first.
- Antigravity feels like the future, but right now (Dec 2025) it's rougher than mature extensions like Kilo Code.

## Recommendations

1. Start with Kilo Code if you live in VSCode — it's the best balance today.
2. Add Cline for planning sessions.
3. Download Antigravity now while it's free and unlimited — the multi-agent workflow is mind-blowing when it works.
4. Master prompt engineering + clear approval workflows.
5. Hybrid everything: Human designs the architecture, agents implement/refactor, human validates/deploys.

Agentic AI is no longer hype — it's shipping code today. But we're still in the "seatbelt required" phase. Experiment aggressively, review ruthlessly, and 2026 is going to be wild.
